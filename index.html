        <h3 class="cover-text">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="cover-text">Hi my name is Bill Kavanagh and this is a website I have made about the history of my home which is located in the south west of county Wicklow near the Carlow and Wexford borders.</p>

          <h3>The coming of the Kavanaghs to the house</h3>
        <p>My ancestors moved into the house around the year 1898. At that time the house was owned by the Fitzwilliam estate. My great great grandmother moved into the house having been forced to leave her old home due to being a widow and having no rights. She moved in with her only son Daniel Kavanagh who was my great grand father.<p> 

        <h3>The Fitzwilliams</h3>
        <p>The Fitzwilliams were one of the wealthiest families in Britain and owned about one fifth of County Wicklow at the time my great great grandmother came to the house. The of the Fitzwilliams died in a plane crash alongside his beloved Kick Kennedy who was the older sister of Bobby Kennedy and Jack Kennedy the former president of the United States.</p>

        <h3>The Farm</h3>
        <p>The house has alwasy been a farmhouse and while much of the land is used for grazing livestock at the moment it was always used to grow crops like: 
          <ul>
            <li>potatoes</li>
            <li>turnips</li>
            <li>cereals</li>
          </ul>
        Back then people had to eat whatever they could grow so it was a very different existance back then. Running water only came to the house in the late in the early 1950's.</p>

        <h3>Former Tenants of the house the Plunkets</h3>
        
        <p>The former owners were a family of Plunkets in which there were three siblings, two men and one woman all unmarried.</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>
        <h5>First Brother</h5>
        </li>
        <p>One of the brothers was murdered for the money he had on his person. He was coming home from Tinahely and stopped at a house on the way home.He asked the owner of the house to let him in as he was going to be killed. He got no refuge at the house and was found dead in a lane closer to the house the next morning with his money and belongings taken.<p>
        <li>
        <h5>Second Brother</h5>
        </li>
        <p>The other brother was found dead in a bog close to the house. he ha also been attacked because people knew his business and that he would be carrying money. In those times people were very poor and poverty was everywhere so it seems oppurtunity had made thieves.
        <li>
        <h5>The Sister</h5>
        </li>
        <p>The sister of the two brothers lived her last few years in one of the neighbours houses who took care of her as she had no family.</p>
