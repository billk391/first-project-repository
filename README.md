Name: Bill Kavanagh Age:26 Address: Rathshanmore, Hacketstown, Co.Carlow, R93FK15 Mobile: 0860427951 email:billk391@hotmail.com

This project is a historical website titled "My house in Rathshanmore".

The project will be written in HTML5 and CSS3.

The two main purposes of the website are to provide informational content about the history of my house and the surrounding area but to also show how proficient I am at making a website demonstrating what I have learned over the course so far.
  
The website will include the history of the owners both past and present of the house, the surrounding countryside, the farm it is on, wildlife around the area.
There will also be a feedback section for people to contribute information they might have or ask questions.
A contact section will be on the bottom of the page also where people can contact me the author and creator of the site and its content.
