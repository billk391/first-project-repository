### Testing User Stories from user Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to quickly be able to discern if the site and its content is relevant to what I have searched for.
        Upon entering the site the content is laid out clearly on the home page with labels on the pictures and the different elements separated depending on their topic.
    
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily move through the pages of the site with little or no effort.
        The navigation links are easy to see at the top right hand side of the page with active and hover properties on them to improve user experience.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find specific bits of historical information.
        The information on the site is broken up depending on the topic. The topics are easy to identify as there are headings on every element.
    
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find an easy way to contact the creator of the website and its content.
        Users are given the facility to contact me the creator of the website as there is a whole page composed of my own address and a link to my facebook page.
    
-    #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to see if there is any more content added to the page.
       The user would already be familiar to a certain degree with the website and any new content would be put on top with the older content further down the page hence making it immediately obvious to the user that new content has been added.

### Further Testing

-   The website was tested on google chrome and safari browsers.
-   The links between the pages were tested extensively.

### Known Bugs

-   The elements coming together on a smaller device screen can overlap.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

1.  Log into Github and locate the actual repository of the project.
2.  When in the project repository click on setting and scroll down to a link for Github pages.
3.  When in Github pages under "Source" there is a drop down menu called "None". Select "Master Branch" from this menu.
4.  The page takes a while to deploy but eventually you care given a green link to the page indicating it was deployed    successfully.
